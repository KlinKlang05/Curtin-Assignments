# Usage # 
To run the program using the GUI, run Main.py using python3, for example, "python3 Main.py"
Then follow the prompts which will lead you to the main menu. If you select the maximum capacity to be 0, the program will prompt for a valid CSV file to import.
There are three example CSV files provided, called all.csv, less.csv, and evenless.csv. After importing the CSV, the file can be used as normal, and will have 
space for 10 more stores to be added. For all intents and purposes and for the requirements of the assignment, I believe that to be enough.
If you select any other number besides 0, the program will create enough space to hold the number of stores that you specified.

From there, the terminal will create a text based GUI and the program can be used as normal. Please ensure that the size of the terminal window is adequate, as too small a 
window size will break the GUI.
